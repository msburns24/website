> world." – Wikidata’s Self-Description

Let’s take a step back to the year 2012. When searching for information, we
often consulted with the collaborative realm of Wikipedia, despite cautions
from our English teachers. This massive source provided a wealth of
information, ranging from ancient historical facts to governmental structures
to Pokémon types.

Despite its usefulness, Wikipedia had 2 main problems: First, it held wide
variation in content between languages. We take this for granted as
English-speakers, but when providing information to billions of people
speaking thousands of languages, making that many updates simply isn’t
feasible. Second, while Wikipedia is useful for one-off research needs, it
provides little benefit when trying to aggregate vast amounts of information.
Imagine creating a Python webscraper for all of Wikipedia, parsing the content
from the HTML documents, utilizing natural language processing to extract
knowledge from the raw information… You get the picture. Not exactly the
easiest approach.

Enter Wikidata. Created by the Wikimedia Deutschland association in October
2012, the project sought to build on Wikipedia by providing consistent,
highly findable data across a variety of domains. The concept of the semantic
web is prevalent in Wikidata, showcasing the creators’ emphasis on meaningful,
interrelated links between pages. In addition, Wikidata allows its data to be
edited by anyone.

## Free, Structured, and Collaborative

Wikidata acts as a database for a wide variety of data, much of which is
sourced from other Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia, Wikibooks, or Wiktionary.
The knowledge base can be accessed and modified by anyone. This provides 3
main benefits:

1. **Free & Accessible:** Like Wikipedia, Wikidata is published under the
   Creative Commons license, letting you copy, modify, or distribute the data
   for any purpose, without requiring permission, and from anywhere on the
   planet.
2. **Structured:** The site provides multiple mechanisms to access its content.
   While the most obvious interface is through their website, wikidata.org, it
   is also possible to query its data using SPARQL queries at
   query.wikidata.org. This bot-friendly approach means Wikidata’s content and
   be aggregated for all sorts of applications.
3. **Collaborative:** The content itself is maintained by Wikidata editors,
   meaning you don’t have to manage the data’s structure and accuracy yourself.
   The site’s many editors use preset rules for content creation, ensuring
   consistency and accuracy across its many languages.

## A Repository of Items

Wikidata is composed of items, each representing a single entity like a person,
company, location, language, etc. To prevent duplication, a unique item
identifier is given to each item, prefixed with a Q (e.g., Douglas Adams has ID
Q42). The more friendly name for an item is called its label, which is
typically the name or title we associate with the object. The item’s header
also contains a description and aliases to allow for clearer understanding and
better findability.

The real power within Wikidata comes from its statements: the key-value pairs
that provide the context for items. Each statement contains a property along
with one or more values that describe it. For example, you may find a person’s
sex/gender, a location’s native language, or a company’s logo and founders. If
a property’s value links to an external database, it is called an identifier.

![Wikidata's Data Model](wikidata-data-model.svg)

In most cases, statements provide a connection to other Wikidata pages,
creating a semantic link between entities. While it initially may appear
unimportant, this subtle addition creates the mechanism that connects items
together, resulting in a complex, interconnected network of information. But
how does this help us? Are links really that important?

## Nodes and Edges

The links created from Wikidata’s item statements provide a powerful structure
to traverse its data. Similar to a graph database, the property values provide
meaningful relationships between pages in the form of nodes (Wikidata items)
and edges (property values). It’s easy to overlook just how useful these links
are. Take Figure 3 for example. Many programmers know that Python is a
descendent of C, much in the same way that English is a descendent of Latin.
However, many aren’t aware of the far-reaching effects of this relationship.

While C influenced both Python and C++ independently, there are other software
packages that benefit from this inheritance. For instance: the Python package
NumPy, a package used in numerous other libraries, is written in both Python
and C. This package inspired Pandas, which builds on the library by providing
stronger analytical tools. While developed separately from Python, C++ is the
primary language used in Matplotlib, one of the most common visual tools in a
data scientist’s toolkit. If that weren’t enough, there is an additional
relationship between NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib: they each receive funding
from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, an organization established by Mark
Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. While it certainly conveys the
strength of the connection between these items, Figure 3 only scratches the
surface of the interconnectedness of Python- and C-based software.

## Applications

While this highly connected structure may seem abstract on the surface, it’s
already in wide use across the web. From visual art to historical timelines to
semantic search, developers and researchers have tapped into the torrent of
information that is Wikidata. While numerous projects have been developed on
top of Wikidata, a few are detailed in the following sections.

### Reasonator

One of the most well-known tools is Reasonator, a web application to make
Wikidata content more readable and engaging. Its creators believed the default
Wikidata interface was too dry, providing more database than story. To
compensate for this, they implemented a custom JavaScript class to query and
render Wikidata content, dynamically pulling data and formatting the results
based on an item’s category. It also provides support for SPARQL queries,
translating results directly into their API, which is useful for advanced users
and custom displays. The result is a semantic front-end that reads cleaner than
the standard Wikidata database.

of Python packages.

### Histropedia

Another stand-out application, Histropedia is an interactive timeline builder
that pulls events, people, and cultural landmarks from Wikidata. Targeted at
researchers and instructors, the application makes it easy to explore and
visualize historical relationships over time.

Users can choose from a library of premade timelines, such as "Presidents of
the United States", or can create their own timelines from scratch. The
software provides flexibility with custom timeline creation, allowing users to
search for items on Wikidata or Wikipedia, then drag and drop them into the
site’s WYSIWYG editor. Lastly, filters can be applied to various searches to
better refine the query by topic, location, or period. By layering a
user-friendly frontend on top of a powerful, knowledge-rich backend,
Histropedia makes it simple to turn raw facts into a visually engaging
narrative.

### Crotos

Last on our list, Crotos exploits the power of Wikidata in a more refined
sense. Considering the over 400,000 artworks cataloged in Wikidata, more than
half of which are in high definition, Crotos aggregates this collection of art
to create a virtual path through an endless art museum. The platform connects
to Wikidata’s backend to allow users to search for artworks by medium (e.g.,
paintings, sculptures, prints), as well as artists, creation date, and a
variety of other metadata. Crotos’ clean interface allows for discovery of art,
which particularly serves museums, educators, or simply the curious individual
looking to gain some culture.

## Where to Begin

Given its connection to the other Wikimedia sites, Wikidata contains just about
any information you can think of. You can search for past U.S. presidents,
finding their birth date and death date, their personal signature, and their
occupations prior to taking office. You can search for cities across the globe,
finding their coordinates, year of inception, and who they are named after. You
can find artistic works, scientific methods, company information, universities,
historical events, and even past elections.

The easiest way to get started is by searching a topic from Wikidata’s main
page. Alternatively, the site provides a handful of quick-start guides, from a
basic introduction to full-fledged tutorials. Wherever you begin, know that
you’re taking a first step onto the limitless, interconnected web of knowledge
that that is Wikidata.
